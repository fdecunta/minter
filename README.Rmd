Helper functions to conduct **m**eta-analysis of **inter**actions with data from 2x2 factorial experiments. 


## Installation

You can install the development version of minter from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("fdecunta/minter", force = TRUE)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(minter)

data(fake_data)

# Compute the effect sizes
fake_data <- inter_effsize(
  effsize = "lnrr",
  colnames = c("Herb", "Fert"),
  data = fake_data,
  Ctrl_mean = C_mean,
  Ctrl_sd = C_sd,
  Ctrl_n = C_n,
  A_mean = Herb_mean,
  A_sd = Herb_sd,
  A_n = Herb_n,
  B_mean = Fert_mean,
  B_sd = Fert_sd,
  B_n = Fert_n,
  AB_mean = HxF_mean,
  AB_sd = HxF_sd,
  AB_n = HxF_n
)

str(fake_data)
```
