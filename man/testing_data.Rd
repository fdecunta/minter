\title{Fake factorial dataset with pre-computed effect sizes}
\format{
A data frame with 10 rows and 24 columns:
\describe{
\item{C_n, C_mean, C_sd}{Sample size, mean, and SD of the Control group}
\item{A_n, A_mean, A_sd}{Sample size, mean, and SD of the A treatment}
\item{B_n, B_mean, B_sd}{Sample size, mean, and SD of the B treatment}
\item{AB_n, AB_mean, AB_sd}{Sample size, mean, and SD of the AB (A and B combined) treatment}
\item{A_main_lnRR, A_main_lnRRv}{Log response ratio for main effect A and its variance}
\item{B_main_lnRR, B_main_lnRRv}{Log response ratio for main effect B and its variance}
\item{AB_main_lnRR, AB_main_lnRRv}{Log response ratio for the AB interaction and its variance}
\item{A_main_SMD, A_main_SMDv}{Standardized mean difference (Hedges' g) for main effect A and its variance}
\item{B_main_SMD, B_main_SMDv}{Standardized mean difference for main effect B and its variance}

\description{
This dataset contains fake data from 2Ã—2 factorial experiments with four treatment groups:
Control (C), Factor A, Factor B, and the combination AB (A and B together). It includes means,
standard deviations, and sample sizes for each group, as well as pre-computed effect sizes:
log response ratio (lnRR), standardized mean difference (SMD), and their variances, for the main
effects of A, B, and the interaction (AB).
}
\details{
This dataset is intended for validating functions that compute or test effect sizes
in meta-analysis workflows involving factorial designs.
