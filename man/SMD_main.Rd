\item{Ctrl_n}{Sample size from the control streatment}

\item{A_mean}{Mean outcome from the A treatment}

\item{A_sd}{Standard deviation from the A treatment}

\item{A_n}{Sample size from the A treatment}

\item{B_mean}{Mean outcome from the B treatment}

\item{B_sd}{Standard deviation from the B treatment}

\description{
Computes the main effect of Factor A across levels of Factor B, analogous
to the main effect in a factorial ANOVA.
}
\details{
See the package vignette for a detailed description of the formula.
