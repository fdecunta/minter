\item{Ctrl_sd}{Standard deviation from the control treatment}

\item{Ctrl_n}{Sample size from the control streatment}

\item{A_mean}{Mean outcome from the treatment}

\item{A_sd}{Standard deviation from the treatment}

\item{A_n}{Sample size from the treatment}

\item{B_mean}{Mean outcome from the B treatment}

\item{B_sd}{Standard deviation from the B treatment}

\item{B_n}{Sample size from the B treatment}

\item{AB_mean}{Mean outcome from the interaction AxB treatment}

\item{AB_sd}{Standard deviation from the interaction AxB treatment}

\item{AB_n}{Sample size from the interaction AxB treatment}
