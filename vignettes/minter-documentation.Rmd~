## Introduction to Effect Sizes

Effect sizes quantify the magnitude of relationships between variables or the size of differences between groups. They are essential for meta-analyses, allowing researchers to compare and combine results across multiple studies.

The **minter** package implements two primary types of effect size calculations:

1. **Factorial design effect sizes**: For experimental designs with two factors (2×2 designs)
2. **Repeated measures effect sizes**: For time-based or before-after treatments

Each function supports different types of effects:

* `ind` - Individual/simple effects (comparing single treatments)
* `main` - Main effects (average effect of a factor across levels of another factor)
* `inter` - Interaction effects (how the effect of one factor depends on the level of another)

## Factorial Design Effect Sizes

These functions calculate effect sizes for standard 2×2 factorial designs where two factors (A and B) are manipulated.

### SMD - Standardized Mean Difference {#smd}

Calculates the standardized mean difference (Hedges' g) for factorial designs, accounting for small-sample bias. This effect size is appropriate when comparing group means on the same scale or when you want to standardize the difference.

#### Effect Types

The package provides three specialized functions for different effect types:

* **`SMD_ind()`**: Individual/simple effect - Compares a single treatment (A) to a control. Use this when you want to know the standardized difference between just one treatment and the control group.
* **`SMD_main()`**: Main effect - Measures the average effect of a factor (A) across all levels of another factor (B). Use this when you want to know the overall effect of a treatment, averaging across other experimental conditions.
* **`SMD_inter()`**: Interaction effect - Quantifies how the effect of one factor (A) depends on the level of another factor (B). Use this when you want to know if two factors interact (i.e., if their combined effect is different from the sum of their individual effects).

These specialized functions are the *recommended* way to calculate effects rather than using the general `SMD(type="...")` function.

#### Formula

For individual effects:

$$d_{ind} = \frac{\bar{X}_A - \bar{X}_{Ctrl}}{S_{pooled}} \cdot J(m)$$

where $S_{pooled} = \sqrt{\frac{(n_A-1)s_A^2 + (n_{Ctrl}-1)s_{Ctrl}^2}{n_A + n_{Ctrl} - 2}}$ and $J(m) = 1 - \frac{3}{4m-1}$ with $m = n_A + n_{Ctrl} - 2$

For main effects:

$$d_{main} = \frac{(\bar{X}_A + \bar{X}_{AB})/2 - (\bar{X}_{Ctrl} + \bar{X}_B)/2}{S_{pooled}} \cdot J(m)$$

where $S_{pooled}$ is the pooled standard deviation for all four groups

For interaction effects:

$$d_{inter} = \frac{(\bar{X}_{AB} - \bar{X}_B) - (\bar{X}_A - \bar{X}_{Ctrl})}{S_{pooled}} \cdot J(m)$$

### lnRR - Log Response Ratio {#lnrr}

Calculates the natural logarithm of the response ratio for factorial designs. This effect size is appropriate when comparing the relative (proportional) differences between experimental groups, and is dimensionless, facilitating comparison across studies using different measurement scales.

#### Effect Types

The package provides three specialized functions for different effect types:

* **`lnRR_ind()`**: Individual/simple effect - Compares a single treatment (A) to a control using the log ratio. Use this when you want to know the proportional difference between one treatment and the control group.
* **`lnRR_main()`**: Main effect - Measures the average proportional effect of a factor (A) across all levels of another factor (B). Use this when you want to know the overall proportional effect of a treatment.
* **`lnRR_inter()`**: Interaction effect - Quantifies how the proportional effect of one factor (A) depends on the level of another factor (B). Use this when you want to know if two factors interact on a multiplicative scale.

These specialized functions are the *recommended* way to calculate effects rather than using the general `lnRR(type="...")` function.

#### Formula

For individual effects:

$$\ln RR_{ind} = \ln\left(\frac{\bar{X}_A}{\bar{X}_{Ctrl}}\right)$$

with variance 
$$v_{ind} = \frac{s_A^2}{n_A\bar{X}_A^2} + \frac{s_{Ctrl}^2}{n_{Ctrl}\bar{X}_{Ctrl}^2}$$

For main effects:

$$\ln RR_{main} = \ln\left(\frac{\bar{X}_A + \bar{X}_{AB}}{\bar{X}_{Ctrl} + \bar{X}_B}\right)$$

with variance 
$$v_{main} = \left(\frac{1}{\bar{X}_A + \bar{X}_{AB}}\right)^2 \left(\frac{s_A^2}{n_A} + \frac{s_{AB}^2}{n_{AB}}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\bar{X}_{Ctrl} + \bar{X}_B}\right)^2 \left(\frac{s_{Ctrl}^2}{n_{Ctrl}} + \frac{s_B^2}{n_B}\right)$$

For interaction effects:

$$\ln RR_{inter} = \ln\left(\frac{\bar{X}_{AB}}{\bar{X}_B}\right) - \ln\left(\frac{\bar{X}_A}{\bar{X}_{Ctrl}}\right)$$

with variance 
$$v_{inter} = \frac{s_{AB}^2}{n_{AB}\bar{X}_{AB}^2} + \frac{s_A^2}{n_A\bar{X}_A^2} + \frac{s_B^2}{n_B\bar{X}_B^2} + \frac{s_{Ctrl}^2}{n_{Ctrl}\bar{X}_{Ctrl}^2}$$
