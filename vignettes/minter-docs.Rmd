The **minter** package provides tools for calculating effect sizes used in meta-analyses, focusing on factorial designs and repeated measures designs. This documentation explains each function, its parameters, and provides examples.

The **minter** package implements two primary types of effect size calculations:

1.  **Factorial design effect sizes**: For experimental designs with two factors (2×2 designs). 
There are three types of effect sizes that can be calculated in this designs:
  - Individual/simple effects (comparing single treatments)
  - Main effects (average effect of a factor across levels of another factor)
  - Interaction effects (how the effect of one factor depends on the level of another)

2.  **Repeated measures effect sizes**: For time-based or before-after treatments.

## Factorial Design Effect Sizes

These functions compute effect sizes for standard 2×2 factorial designs where two factors (A and B) are manipulated.

Effect sizes for factorial meta-analysis appeared for the first time in Gurevitch et al. 2000.
In this paper, the authors presented the idea of estimating effect sizes for
factorial experiments analogous to the estimation of main and interaction effects in ANOVA. 
They done this for the Standardized Mean Difference, and the approach was later expanded for other
kind of effect sizes. 

Recently, Shinichi Nakagawa and Daniel Noble derived different families of effect sizes
for factorial experiments, like lnVR or lnCVR, and kindly shared those formulas.

### SMD - Standardized Mean Difference {#smd}

#### `SMD_ind()`

This function computes the individual or simple effect of Factor A over the Control treatment.

It is the classic Standardized Mean Difference (SMD), which can also be computed
with metafor's `escalc()` function using `measure = "SMD"`.

The individual Standardized Mean Difference of Factor A is calculated as:

$$
d_{ind} = \frac{\bar{X}_A - \bar{X}_{Ctrl}}{S_{pooled}} \cdot J(m)
$$


where:


$$
S_{pooled} = \sqrt{\frac{(n_A-1)s_A^2 + (n_{Ctrl}-1)s_{Ctrl}^2}{n_A + n_{Ctrl} - 2}}
$$

The $J(m)$ is a correction for small-sample bias introduced by Hedges (**REF**). This is used
by default in `minter`, but can be turned off with `hedges_correction = FALSE`.

This factor is computed as:

$$J(m) = 1 - \frac{3}{4m-1}$$ 

with $$m = n_A + n_{Ctrl} - 2$$

And the sampling variance is:

$$
var(d_{ind}) = \frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_{Ctrl}} + \frac{d^2}{2(n_A + n_{Ctrl})}
$$

#### `SMD_main()`

To compute the main effect of Factor A:

$$d_{main} = \frac{(\bar{X}_A + \bar{X}_{AB}) - (\bar{X}_{B} + \bar{X}_{Ctrl})}{2S_{pooled}} \cdot J(m)$$

The correction for small-sample bias $J$ is the same shown above, but the degrees of freedom
are now: $m = n_A + n_B + n_{AB} + n_{Ctrl} - 4$

In this case $S_{pooled}$ is the pooled standard deviation for all four groups:

$$S_{pooled} = \sqrt{\frac{(n_A-1)s_A^2 + (n_B-1)s_B^2 + (n_{AB}-1)s_{AB}^2 + (n_{Ctrl}-1)s_{Ctrl}^2}{n_A + n_B + n_{AB} + n_{Ctrl} - 4}}$$
Where the sampling variance is:

$$
var(d_{main}) = \frac{1}{4} \left(
\frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B} + \frac{1}{n_{AB}} + \frac{1}{n_{Ctrl}} +
\frac{d_A^2}{2(n_A + n_B + n_{AB} + n_{Ctrl})}
\right)
$$

#### `SMD_inter()`

For interaction effects:

$$d_{inter} = \frac{(\bar{X}_{AB} - \bar{X}_B) - (\bar{X}_A - \bar{X}_{Ctrl})}{S_{pooled}} \cdot J(m)$$

where $S_{pooled}$ is the pooled standard deviation for all four groups, calculated 
using the same formula than [SMD_main()](#smd_main).

And the sampling variance is:

$$
var(d_{inter}) = \frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B} + \frac{1}{n_{AB}} + \frac{1}{n_{Ctrl}} +
\frac{d_{Inter}^2}{2(n_A + n_B + n_{AB} + n_{Ctrl})}
$$

### lnRR - Log Response Ratio {#lnrr}

Calculates the natural logarithm of the response ratio for factorial designs. This effect size is appropriate when comparing the relative (proportional) differences between experimental groups, and is dimensionless, facilitating comparison across studies using different measurement scales.

#### Formula

##### `lnRR_ind()`

For individual effects:

$$
\ln RR_{ind} = \ln\left(\frac{\bar{X}_A}{\bar{X}_{Ctrl}}\right)
$$



with variance 

$$
v_{ind} = \frac{s_A^2}{n_A\bar{X}_A^2} + \frac{s_{Ctrl}^2}{n_{Ctrl}\bar{X}_{Ctrl}^2}
$$



##### `lnRR_main()`

For main effects:

$$
\ln RR_{main} = \ln\left(\frac{\bar{X}_A + \bar{X}_{AB}}{\bar{X}_{Ctrl} + \bar{X}_B}\right)
$$


with variance 

$$
v_{main} = \left(\frac{1}{\bar{X}_A + \bar{X}_{AB}}\right)^2 \left(\frac{s_A^2}{n_A} + \frac{s_{AB}^2}{n_{AB}}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\bar{X}_{Ctrl} + \bar{X}_B}\right)^2 \left(\frac{s_{Ctrl}^2}{n_{Ctrl}} + \frac{s_B^2}{n_B}\right)

$$


with variance

$$
v_{inter} = \frac{s_{AB}^2}{n_{AB}\bar{X}_{AB}^2} + \frac{s_A^2}{n_A\bar{X}_A^2} + \frac{s_B^2}{n_B\bar{X}_B^2} + \frac{s_{Ctrl}^2}{n_{Ctrl}\bar{X}_{Ctrl}^2}
